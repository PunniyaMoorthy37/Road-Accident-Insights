🎯 Objective & Problem Statement:

To help transportation departments identify causes, locations, and time patterns of road accidents. Traditional logs lacked real-time insights and visual analytics to support safety initiatives.

📌 Project Description:

Developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze accident data across different parameters like vehicle type, location, time of day, and cause. The dashboard supports the formulation of targeted traffic policies and safety measures.

🛠️ Technology Used:

Power BI, DAX, Power Query, Excel

✨ Key Features:

1. Filters for accident type, vehicle, day, and region

2. Visual comparison of fatal vs. non-fatal accidents

3. Heatmaps to highlight accident-prone zones

4. Time slot-based analysis of accidents (e.g., peak hours)

5. Insight cards for quick view of total deaths, injuries, and cases
